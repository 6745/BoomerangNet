# BoomerangNet
A 3rd party network for Beatcraft Cyclon, written in Flask. 

## *What goes around, comes around, like a boomerang!*
Legit one of the best songs in this game

## What is the purpose of this?
Beatcraft Cyclon is a really fun game, so I decided to start working on a server for it!

## How to use
Well, I've not written much code to make this easy to use, but you'll just want to run the startup file in the root of the repo. Since this is flask, starting in a prod environment is trivial, and I'll work on that soon.

You'll also need to import the song database. This is located in Cyclon/Data/Script/DiscStock.csv
To import, use the `importsongs` tool.

## DISCLAIMER (will remove when server is done)
This server is very incomplete! I plan on having it done this weekend, but I want to open up the repo a bit.

## PostScript
I ***know*** this server is not the greatest programming masterpiece you've seen in your entire life, trust me. I just decided to work on this since I now have a kit. I at least wrote it. You think you can do better than me? PROOVE IT and submit a PR.
